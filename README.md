# Authentication and Testing Sprint Challenge

**Read these instructions carefully. Understand exactly what is expected _before_ starting this Sprint Challenge.**

This challenge allows you to practice the concepts and techniques learned over the past sprint and apply them in a concrete project. This sprint explored **Authentication and Testing**. During this sprint, you studied **authentication, JSON web tokens, unit testing, and backend testing**. In your challenge this week, you will demonstrate your mastery of these skills by creating **a dad jokes app**.

This is an individual assessment. All work must be your own. Your challenge score is a measure of your ability to work independently using the material covered through this sprint. You need to demonstrate proficiency in the concepts and objectives introduced and practiced in preceding days.

You are not allowed to collaborate during the sprint challenge. However, you are encouraged to follow the twenty-minute rule.

## Introduction

Dad jokes are all the rage these days! In this challenge, you will build a real wise-guy application.

Users must be able to call the `[POST] /api/auth/register` endpoint to create a new account, and the `[POST] /api/auth/login` endpoint to get a token.

We also need to make sure nobody without the token can call `[GET] /api/jokes` and gain access to our dad jokes.

We will hash the user's password using `bcryptjs`, and use JSON Web Tokens and the `jsonwebtoken` library.

## Instructions

### Task 1: Project Set Up

- [ X ] Fork the project and clone it to your machine.
- [ X ] Set up your fork settings in Github to submit via Codegrade.
- [ X ] Create a new branch: `git checkout -b <firstName-lastName>`.
- [ X ] Implement the project on your newly created branch, committing changes regularly.
- [ ] Push commits regularly: `git push origin <firstName-lastName>`.
- [ ] Run the tests inside `./api/server.test.js` locally by executing `npm test`.
- [ ] Run the Codegrade tests locally by executing `npm run codegrade`.

  **Important:**

  If you already have a fork of this project in your Github account, you _must_ delete it, re-fork and re-clone.

### Task 2: Project Requirements

Your finished project must include all of the following requirements (further instructions are found inside each file):

- [ ] An authentication workflow with functionality for account creation and login, implemented inside `./api/auth/auth-router.js`.
- [ ] Middleware used to restrict access to resources from non-authenticated requests, implemented inside `./api/middleware/restricted.js`.
- [ ] A minimum of 2 tests per API endpoint, implemented inside `./api/server.test.js`. The `package.json` includes the "test" script.

**Notes:**

- You are welcome to create additional files but **do not move or rename existing files** or folders.
- Do not alter your `package.json` file except to install extra libraries. The "test" script has been added for you.
- The database already has the `users` table, but if you run into issues, the migration is available.
- In your solution, it is essential that you follow best practices and produce clean and professional results.
- Schedule time to review, refine, and assess your work and perform basic professional polishing including spell-checking and grammar-checking on your work.
- It is better to submit a challenge that meets MVP than one that attempts too much and does not.

### Task 3: Stretch Goals

**IMPORTANT:** Work on stretch goals in a **new branch**. You can branch off `<firstName-lastName>` by executing `git checkout -b stretch`.

After finishing your required elements, you can push your work further. These goals may or may not be things you have learned in this module but they build on the material you just studied. Time allowing, stretch your limits and see if you can deliver on the following optional goals:

- [ ] Write at least 4 tests per endpoint.
- [ ] Extract user validation into a separate method and write unit tests for it.
- [ ] Implement authentication using sessions instead of tokens.

## Submission format

Submit via Codegrade. Remember to add a query string to your Webhook's Payload URL specifying your `<firstName-lastName>` branch:

```
  https://example.com/example?branch=jane-doe
```

## Interview Questions

Be prepared to demonstrate your understanding of this week's concepts by answering questions on the following topics.

1. Differences between using _sessions_ or _JSON Web Tokens_ for authentication.

we can think of sessions as authorization and JWT as authentication. just because we are authorized doesnt mean that we are authenticated. with JWT we are able to tranfer data from one party to antother, where with sessions they are used to allow a server to store information about a client, then that information can then be used for a variety of purposes.


2. What does `bcryptjs` do to help us store passwords in a secure manner?

bycrypt allows us to hash the password, implements salting both manually and automatically as well as accumulative hashing rounds. this makes it difficult for rainbow chart hacking. 

3. How are unit tests different from integration and end-to-end testing?

unit testing allows us to isolate and test small units of code to check for their functionality, where integration and end-to-end tesint allows us ot test the entire application to make sure that the functioanllity is working correctly all the way through.

4. How does _Test Driven Development_ change the way we write applications and tests?

test driven development allows us to write the test before we write the actual code. we are then able to make the test fail first and then write the correct code to get the test to pass.
